Main file is located on cypress > e2e > spec.cy.js

Disclaimer:
It is my first time to do test script using Cypress, a sample file from github \is downloaded so that it has already the complete dependencies that I needed then overwrite spec.cy.js to start on my own code.
It's not working on the payment side since I got stuck on familiarizing how iframe works on Cypress.
